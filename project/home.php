  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Pitt Club Swimming! We are a brand new award winning club that started out in the Fall of 2011. Many of us are former high school swimmers looking for a way to get back into the sport we love to hate, while others simply want a good workout. Thank you for your support. If you are a Pitt student, we encourage you to try out a few practices to see what you think!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Our club is fairly new, founded 2011, but we have had great successes so far. We are now one of the larger sports clubs at Pitt. We compete in a few meets a semester, almost always being one of the top three teams. We travel to other universities at least once a semester and hold a meet ourselves at least once a year.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We have student coaches at each practice. They have been swimmers for years or they are on the universityâ€™s varsity swim team.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We welcome anyone that would like to join our team. Our team has a wide range of skill. Some members traveled to nationals in their high school careers. Some members have never swam competitively before. We accommodate everyone, and everyone is allowed to compete at the meets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In addition to the exercise part of the club, we also like to focus on social and volunteer activities. We have pasta parties, Market (the larger dinning hall on campus) dinners, and other fun events to get to know our teammates outside of the pool. We also help with varsity, high school, and charity meets that the pool hosts, and we raised over $2,000 at relay for life this past year.
